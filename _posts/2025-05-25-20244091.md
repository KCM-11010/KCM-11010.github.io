description: Equivariant neural networks are powerful tools for machine learning tasks involving data with inherent symmetries. Their power stems from their ability to encode known transformations directly into their architecture, providing a strong inductive bias, especially in domains like physics, chemistry, and computer vision.

Invariant and equivariant neural networks have become a crucial tool in machine learning, particularly for tasks where data exhibits inherent *symmetries*. These symmetries, such as rotations or permutations, are mathematical transformations that leave certain properties of the data unchanged. By incorporating these symmetries into the network architecture, the enhanced models offer improved generalization, enhanced data efficiency, and greater interpretability. However, the development of such networks is not without its challenges.

We will delve into recent research that addresses some of the key challenges in the field of invariant/equivariant networks and how they are tackled. In particular, we will see how invariance/equivariance could be achieved for existing architectures via 'averaging', rather than explicity design them from the scratch. Then, we will see what are the shortcomings of the proposed 'averaging' methods and how they are recently revised.

## A quick cover on invariance and equivariance

In the field of geometric deep learning, the main focus is to design or obtain a network architecture that properly reflects the geometry, or the symmetries within the dataset. Such symmetries typically originate from the structure of the domain underlying the input signals. For instance, consider the image dataset (refer to the following figure by <d-cite key="bronstein2021geometric"></d-cite>). The domain $\Omega$ is a $n$-by-$n$ grid, where $n$ is an integer, and the space of signals $\mathcal{X}(\Omega)$ consists of the signals $x: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^3$.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets\img\2025-05-25-20244091\DomSig.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Assume that the machine learning system operates on signals on some domain $\Omega$, where the space of the signals $\mathcal{X}(\Omega)$ is a Hilbert space, that is, a linear combination and inner product among the signals are available.

<br>

Notice that the collection of symmetries satisfies a number of properties: a composition of two symmetries is again a symmetry, and its inverse, which always exists, is also a symmetry. These properties naturally define a group that consists of the symmetries. Formally, a *group* $G$ is a set equipped with a binary operation <d-footnote>For brevity and following the common notation, we juxtapose the first argument with the second. </d-footnote> $*:G\times G \to G$ satisfying the following axioms:
$$
\begin{center}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Associativity}&: (g_1g_2)g_3 = g_1(g_2g_3),\quad \forall g_1, g_2, g_3 \in G.\\
    \text{Identity Element}&: \exists e\in G \;\;\text{s.t.}\;\; eg = g = ge,\quad \forall g\in G.\\
    \text{Inverse Element}&: \forall g\in G, \exists g^{-1}\in G \;\;\text{s.t.}\;\; gg^{-1} = e = g^{-1}g.
\end{aligned}
\end{center}
$$

<br>

The gist of the introduction of groups $(G,\*)$ of symmetry is to study how the group acts on the data. We will first define how the group acts on the domain $\Omega$. The action of the group on the signal space $\mathcal{X}(\Omega)$ would then be naturally obtained.

A group $(G, \*)$ acts on $\Omega$ by the (left) *group action* $\cdot : G\times\Omega \to \Omega$ that satisfies
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Compatibility}&: (g_1g_2)\cdot\omega = g_1\cdot(g_2\cdot \omega),\quad \forall g_1, g_2 \in G, \omega\in\Omega.\\
    \text{Identity Element}&: e_G\cdot\omega = \omega,\quad \forall \omega\in\Omega.
\end{aligned}
$$

An action of $G$ on $\mathcal{X}(\Omega)$ is naturally obtained from that on $\Omega$:
$$
\begin{equation*}
    (g.x)(\omega) \triangleq x\left(g^{-1}\cdot\omega\right).
\end{equation*}
$$

As we assumed that the signal space is a Hilbert space, we can represent the action of each symmetry by some (invertible) matrix. Given some vector space $V$, a *group representation* is a map $\rho: G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ that assigns each group element to an invertible matrix and satisfies $\rho(gh) = \rho(g)\rho(h)$, for all $g, h \in G$.

<br>

Now we can define the invariance and the equivariance of a function. A function $f:\mathcal{X}(\Omega) \to \mathcal{Y}$ is $G$**-invariant** if, for all $g \in G, x\in\mathcal{X}$,
$$
f(\rho(g)x) = f(x).
$$
Similarly, a function $f:\mathcal{X}(\Omega) \to \mathcal{X}(\Omega')$ is $G$**-equivariant** if, for all $g \in G, x\in\mathcal{X}$,
$$
f(\rho(g)x) = \rho'(g)f(x),
$$
where $G$ is assumed to act both on $\mathcal{X}(\Omega)$ and $\mathcal{X}(\Omega')$, $\rho'$ is the group representation of $\mathcal{X}(\Omega')$. In words, a function is $G$-invariant if its output remains intact whatever the symmetry in $G$ acted on the input. On the other hand, a function is $G$-equivariant if its output is modified accordingly to the acted symmetry on the input.

## Achieving in(equi)variance from existing models

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

In fact, you can also use a single dollar sign `$` to create inline formulas, such as `$ E = mc^2 $`, which will render as $ E = mc^2 $. This approach provides the same effect during TeX-based compilation, but visually it appears slightly less bold compared to double-dollar signs `$$`, making it blend more naturally with surrounding text.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

## Limitation of CAN

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.
